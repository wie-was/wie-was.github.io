      <description>Song: The Beatles - Blackbird
Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun tutorial to learn this song on guitar:   I fiddled around with this song on both bass and guitar, and found it hard to remember the form. Therefore I made myself a quick sheet to remember it:
   Music Lyrics     Main riff (only 1st part) -   Main riff (full 3 parts) Blackbird singing in the dead of nightTake these broken wings and learn to flyAll your lifeYou were only waiting for this moment to arise   C down cadence -   Main riff (full 3 parts) Blackbird singing in the dead of nightTake these sunken eyes and learn to seeAll your lifeYou were only waiting for this moment to be free   Fly riff Blackbird flyBlackbird flyInto the light of the dark black night   Main riff (full 3 parts) -   Fly riff Blackbird flyBlackbird flyInto the light of the dark black night   Main riff (only 1st part)Ritardando towards and repeat high G chord -   Up to C and back down riff.</description>
