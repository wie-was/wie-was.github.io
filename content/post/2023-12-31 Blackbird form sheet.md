Song: [The Beatles - Blackbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Man4Xw8Xypo)

I'm in the process of learning this song on bass and guitar, but found it hard to remember the form.

The sheet below therefore serves as a way to remember the form and lyrics, once you _already_ learned the chords - which you can do eg. here: {{< youtube 5TnySn2KqD4 >}}
