Song: [The Beatles - Blackbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Man4Xw8Xypo)

Here's a fun tutorial to learn this song on guitar: {{< youtube 5TnySn2KqD4 >}}

I fiddled around with this song on both bass and guitar, and found it hard to remember the form. Therefore I made myself a quick sheet to remember it:
